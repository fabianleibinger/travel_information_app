A flutter project.

The travel information app serves as the frontend of the travel information system, and therefore accesses the Mobility Gateway via Http.
The Mobility Gateway is a gateway to a preference service and the Routing Gateway.
The smartphone app, which is available for iOS and Android, is able to build routing requests according to the mobility preferences of a user.

At last the singleton user class represents the current user of the app and saves runtime information.
